a CLI commit message builder to improve the experience of writing actually useful commit messages.

follows the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/) specs. 

intended to be used in place of `git commit` + optional no-op (`-n`) and push (`-p`) flags. shell script, so you can treat it like a binary. `bash` and `zsh` compatible. dropdown options are configurable (check the `Makefile` for where they live after `make install`) and are intended to be project-specific.
